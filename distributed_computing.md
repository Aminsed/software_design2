I want to create a python library that perhaps also integrates with kubernetes so that a datascientist will bring their pytorch code and they can distrubte the training across multiple node connected through RDMA. each worker node may have a different hardware and our python library should be able to automatically connect the new nodes once they've been physically added. How should I go about this library? what would the architechture of this project look like?
