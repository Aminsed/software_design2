**Explanation:**

*   **Kubernetes 1.28.0 (Local Cluster):**  Provides the orchestration platform for isolating model executions. The specific version is chosen for its stability and ease of installation using `Minikube`.
*   **Model Container (Docker 24.0.6):**  Encapsulates the model code in an immutable container with specific libraries pinned with versions (`pmdarima==1.8.5`). The version is explicitly pinned for reproducibility and security concerns. The container image is built using  `FROM python:3.11.6-slim` to keep the image as small as possible and avoid unnecessary software that could lead to security issues.
*   **Python 3.11.6:** Provides the programming language for both model execution and the web application. Pinned version to minimize dependency issues.
*   **`pmdarima==1.8.5`:** Library for time-series forecasting. Pinned version for reproducibility. The library has minimal external dependencies and is very stable.
*   **PostgreSQL 15.4:** Stores user information, model metadata, subscription details, and predictions. The specific version is chosen for stability and security.
*   **Flask 2.3.2:**  The Python web framework handles API requests, user authentication, subscription management, and generates the HTML for visualization. The specific version is chosen for its stability and its simple and easy-to-use features.
*  **`psycopg2==2.9.6`:** The Python library to connect to PostgreSQL. The version is pinned to avoid conflicts and for compatibility with PostgreSQL 15.4.
*   **Isolated Pod:** Represents the Kubernetes pod in which the model container runs. This is the completely sandboxed execution environment for the model. The model is completely isolated from the rest of the system.
*   **Read-Only Filesystem, Minimal User Privileges, No Network:** These are critical security measures implemented at the container level, enforcing absolute least privilege. The container has no write access, is executed with a specific user ID, and has no internet access to avoid any kind of malicious network communication.
*  **`NetworkPolicy`**: Kubernetes Network Policy is explicitly configured to block all incoming traffic, and all outgoing traffic from the Pod, ensuring that the Model Container cannot connect to the external world or communicate with other containers or services. This is a non-negotiable requirement to ensure the system's security.
* **`PodSecurityContext`**: Kubernetes Pod Security Context is explicitly configured to enforce a read-only filesystem, run as an unprivileged user, and prevents privilege escalation to avoid any kind of malicious activity. This is a non-negotiable security requirement.
*   **Dynamic Database Credentials:**  Short-lived credentials for each model instance prevent lateral movement in the database.
*   **HTTPS (Token Auth):** User requests are authenticated with a very simple token system (avoiding external authentication libraries for simplicity in the MVP) for this MVP.
*   **RESTful API:** A simple RESTful API serves as the primary communication interface.
*   **Immutable Docker Images:** The model container image is built using `docker build --no-cache`, ensuring that no cached information or intermediate steps are included, guaranteeing a reproducible and clean build every single time.
*   **User (Web Browser):** The user interacts with the system through a web browser to make subscriptions, upload models, and view predictions.

**Security Flow:**

1.  **User Authentication:**  Users authenticate with a token sent in the `Authorization` header. The token is generated by a very simple custom implementation in Python when the user subscribes (avoiding complex external authentication libraries). It uses a hardcoded secret key for the MVP.
2.  **Model Upload:** The web application receives the model code.
3.  **Container Creation:** The web application creates a new container from the base image, adding the model code. This prevents reusing an old container that may contain stale data.
4.  **Dynamic Database Credentials:**  The application generates unique, short-lived database credentials for the model pod, grants specific access, and passes the connection string as a parameter to the pod. The connection string is never hardcoded in the model code or in the docker image.
5.  **Sandboxed Execution:** The container runs within a Kubernetes pod with a read-only filesystem, no network access, minimal user privileges, and network isolation with `NetworkPolicy`.
6.  **Model Prediction:** The model executes inside the sandboxed environment, connects to the database with the short-lived credentials, and executes its prediction logic. The results are stored in the database.
7.  **Visualization:** The user fetches predictions via the API, which are visualized through a simple server-rendered page.

**2. Component Descriptions (In-Depth, Practical)**

*   **Kubernetes (1.28.0):**  Local Kubernetes cluster (Minikube or kind) is the core infrastructure. It provides the pod-based isolation and resource management for our MVP.
    *   **Rationale:** Kubernetes (specifically, the local Kubernetes cluster using `minikube` or `kind`) is chosen for its mature ecosystem and capability to handle container orchestration locally, while providing a good approximation of a production environment. It also provides strong isolation and security capabilities by using `PodSecurityContext` and `NetworkPolicy`.
    *   **Security:** Kubernetes provides robust features for sandboxing, isolation, network control, and resource management, which are critical in this MVP.
    *   **Installation:**  Install `minikube` using the official instructions ([https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)) or `kind` using the official instructions ([https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)). Start the cluster with `minikube start` or `kind create cluster`.
*   **Docker (24.0.6):** Containerization technology to encapsulate model code.
    *   **Rationale:** Docker is chosen for its ease of use and wide acceptance in development. It also is a good match with Kubernetes as the containerization technology.
    *   **Security:** Docker is used for building immutable images.
    *   **Installation:** Install Docker from the official website: [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
*   **Python (3.11.6):** The core programming language for the application logic, model execution, and API.
    *   **Rationale:** Python is chosen for its mature ecosystem in data science, machine learning, and web development, and ease of use.
    *   **Security:** Avoid using unverified libraries. Use only trusted libraries with pinned versions.
    *   **Installation:** Install using a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -U pip
    ```
*   **Flask (2.3.2):** Micro-framework for building the web application and APIs.
    *   **Rationale:** Flask is chosen because it is lightweight, easy to understand, and well-documented, which makes it very suitable for this MVP, given the limited experience with web frameworks.
    *   **Security:** Flask is secure, and its simplicity allows you to carefully design the application without introducing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Installation:** `pip install Flask==2.3.2`
*   **`psycopg2` (2.9.6):** Python library to connect to PostgreSQL.
    *   **Rationale:** `psycopg2` is chosen for its good security practices when parameterizing SQL queries, as well as for its stability.
    *   **Security:** Use parameterized SQL queries to avoid SQL injection.
    *    **Installation:** `pip install psycopg2==2.9.6`
*    **`pmdarima` (1.8.5):** Library for ARIMA time series forecasting.
    *    **Rationale:** `pmdarima` is chosen as an example of an ARIMA library. The library is well documented and easy to use.
    *    **Security:** `pmdarima` does not depend on external APIs to provide time series forecasting.
    *    **Installation:** `pip install pmdarima==1.8.5`
*   **PostgreSQL (15.4):** Database for persistent storage.
    *   **Rationale:** PostgreSQL is a mature, robust, and secure open-source relational database, which makes it a good choice for storing critical data.
    *   **Security:** Data in the database is protected by access control and specific user privileges for the model.
    *    **Installation:** Install PostgreSQL from the official website: [https://www.postgresql.org/download/](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
*   **Model Execution Sandbox (Isolated Kubernetes Pod):**
    *   **Rationale:** Kubernetes pods provide the perfect isolation mechanism needed to run the model.
    *   **Security:** This is where the most critical security measures are implemented, with a read-only file system, specific user ID, and network isolation enforced using `PodSecurityContext` and `NetworkPolicy`. The model runs in a secure container with minimal privileges and network access.
        *   **Read-Only Filesystem:** Prevents any kind of modification to the container's file system, ensuring that the model code cannot be changed during execution. Configured using `securityContext` with `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` in the Kubernetes pod definition.
        *   **Minimal User Privileges:** The model container runs with a non-root user, configured using `runAsUser: 1000` and `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false` in the `securityContext` to prevent privilege escalation.
        *   **No Network Access:** The model container has NO network access, preventing the model from making external calls and exfiltrating data. Configured using a `NetworkPolicy` that denies all egress and ingress traffic.

**Kubernetes Configurations (Concrete Examples):**

*   **Pod Security Context (Example `pod.yaml`):**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: model-pod
  labels:
    app: model-pod
spec:
  securityContext:
    readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
    runAsUser: 1000
    allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  containers:
    - name: model-container
      image: model-image # Placeholder
```

* **Rationale**:
    *   `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`: This makes the container's root file system read-only, preventing any changes to the container's internal files by the user and the application. This avoids malicious code that attempts to modify the container's file system.
    *   `runAsUser: 1000`: Runs the container as an unprivileged user instead of `root` which reduces the potential attack surface. If the container is compromised, an unprivileged user has limited capabilities. This is a Linux user ID, it can be any user in your system.
    * `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`: prevents privilege escalation within the container. This means that even if the user finds an exploit in the application, they will not be able to escalate their privileges inside the container.

*   **Network Policy (Example `networkpolicy.yaml`):**

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: model-pod-networkpolicy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: model-pod
  ingress:
    from: []
  egress: []
```

*   **Rationale**: This `NetworkPolicy` explicitly denies all incoming and outgoing traffic from the model container (ingress and egress rules are empty). This creates an impenetrable network sandbox. No network communication is allowed from the container.

*  **Deployment:** Apply the configurations using `kubectl apply -f pod.yaml` and `kubectl apply -f networkpolicy.yaml`.

**3. RESTful API Design (Ultra-Minimal, Practical)**

All endpoints will return JSON responses with the appropriate HTTP response code. A simple token-based authentication is implemented by including a header called `Authorization: Bearer <token>` in every request.

**Token-Based Authentication (Simple, Custom Implementation for MVP):**

*   **Token Generation (Simplified Example):** For this MVP, the tokens are generated using a simple hardcoded secret key and a very simple token generation function for demo purposes only. This is not production ready and should be replaced in a production environment.
```python
import hashlib

SECRET_KEY = "my_secret_key_for_this_mvp" # PLEASE REPLACE THIS IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT
def generate_token(user_id):
  """Generates a SHA256 token based on user ID and a hardcoded secret key"""
  token_string = f"{user_id}-{SECRET_KEY}"
  token = hashlib.sha256(token_string.encode()).hexdigest()
  return token
```
* **Token Storage:** For this MVP, tokens will be stored in memory in a dictionary in the Flask app. In a real-world application, you would use a database or a dedicated token storage mechanism. The database will store the generated token and the user id, with a relation to the subscription record.

```python
  # In a real application, this would be stored in the database
  tokens = {}

  @app.route("/subscribe", methods=["POST"])
  def subscribe():
    #... create user record, generate user token, store in the in-memory dict
    token = generate_token(user_id)
    tokens[token] = user_id
  # ... access the token, retrieve the user using `tokens[token]`
```

*   **Token Validation:** Each request validates the token present in the `Authorization` header to identify the user making the request. If the token is valid, the request continues.

*   **Example Request Header:**
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <generated_token>
    ```

**API Endpoints:**

**4. Phased Development Plan (Ultra-Minimal End-to-End MVP)**

*   **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure and End-to-End MVP (10 days - 3 hrs/day)**
    1.  **Day 1-2: Environment Setup and Database Design:** Set up the local Kubernetes cluster (Minikube/kind), install Docker and PostgreSQL. Design the database schema and create the tables in PostgreSQL.
    2.  **Day 3: Flask API Skeleton:** Create a very minimal Flask application with the required API endpoints, using a simple token-based authentication. This will be a basic API that is not fully functional yet.
    3.  **Day 4: Dockerize the Flask API:** Create a simple Dockerfile to containerize the Flask application. Create a basic Kubernetes deployment file for the Flask app, and deploy it to the local Kubernetes cluster.
    4.  **Day 5-6:  Model Execution Sandbox (Minimal):** Create a Dockerfile for the model sandbox, including the read-only filesystem configuration, minimal user, and no network access. Create a Kubernetes `Pod` that can deploy the container. Implement the secure database credential generation mechanism, but for this MVP, use a hardcoded user name and password with read-only access. Make the model run hourly using a very simple crontab within the container.
    5.  **Day 7: Model Deployment API:** Implement the POST `/models` endpoint to receive model code, create a new container, and deploy it to Kubernetes. Implement the most minimal model deployment functionality. Use a hardcoded user and password for the database connection.
    6.  **Day 8: Basic Model Execution & Prediction:** Create a minimal Python model that connects to the database, performs a simple prediction, and saves the output in the database.
    7.  **Day 9: Subscription Management API (Mock):** Implement basic subscription management (mock payment handling) using POST `/subscriptions` to subscribe, and GET `/subscriptions` to view active subscriptions. Implement a very simple and direct subscription creation mechanism.
    8.  **Day 10: End-to-End Testing:** Perform basic end-to-end tests to ensure that all pieces are working together and that the model is executed securely and outputs the data as expected. Create an extremely simple HTML page using Jinja2 to list all of the current predictions.

*   **Phase 2: Data Visualization and Security Enhancements (5 days - 3 hrs/day)**
    1. **Day 11: API Authentication:**  Implement the full token-based authentication for the Flask app. Protect all API endpoints with the authentication mechanism.
    2.  **Day 12: Dynamic Database Credentials:** Implement the logic to generate short-lived database credentials for models per execution.
    3.  **Day 13: Simple Data Visualization:** Implement a simple web page (using Jinja2 and htmx) to display historical predictions using the Chart.js library via server-side rendering, without any JavaScript. Use inline CSS to avoid any complexity.
    4.  **Day 14:  Refactor, Clean Up and Documentation:** Review code, clean it up, and write documentation for the project.
    5.  **Day 15:  Refactor, Clean Up and Documentation:** Review code, clean it up, and write documentation for the project.

**5. Complete Database Schema (PostgreSQL DDL - Secure, Minimal)**

```sql
-- Connect to your PostgreSQL database. Ensure you have created a database called `model_platform`
-- before executing the script.

CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    subscription_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
     token VARCHAR (256) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE models (
    model_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    model_code TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE predictions (
    prediction_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    model_id INTEGER REFERENCES models(model_id),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    actual NUMERIC,
    predicted NUMERIC
);

-- Initial example data
INSERT INTO users (subscription_date, token) VALUES (NOW(), 'a_valid_token_string');
INSERT INTO models (name, description, model_code) VALUES ('TestModel', 'A Test Model', 'print("This is a test model.")');
INSERT INTO predictions (model_id, timestamp, actual, predicted) VALUES (1, NOW(), 10.0, 10.2);
-- Example Read-Only User for Models
CREATE ROLE model_read_role;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE predictions TO model_read_role;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE models TO model_read_role;
-- This is the user that the model uses for its operations.
-- Create dynamic users with a new password every time a model runs
-- using this structure: model_user_<random_number>
-- and grant them access like this
-- CREATE USER model_user_1234 WITH PASSWORD 'very_strong_password';
-- GRANT model_read_role TO model_user_1234;
```

**Rationale:**

*   **`users` Table:** Stores basic user information (id, subscription date, token). The token is unique to avoid duplication.
*   **`models` Table:** Stores model metadata (id, name, description, model code). The model code is stored as plain text.
*   **`predictions` Table:** Stores model prediction results (id, model id, timestamp, actual value, predicted value). The model id references the models table to establish the relationship between models and predictions.
*   **Data Types:** Specific data types (`SERIAL`, `VARCHAR`, `TEXT`, `TIMESTAMP`, `NUMERIC`) are used for optimal storage and query performance.
*   **`NOT NULL` Constraints:** Ensures data integrity and prevents null values in critical fields.
*   **`PRIMARY KEY` Constraints:** Defines primary keys for efficient indexing.
*  **Read-Only User:** The `model_read_role` is used for model access, allowing the model to only read the `predictions` and `models` tables, and avoiding any kind of modifications to the database from the model application.
*   **SQL Injection Prevention:** Use parameterized queries via `psycopg2` to prevent SQL injection, and avoid string interpolation when accessing the database.  **Example with Python and `psycopg2`:**
```python
import psycopg2
# ... assuming connection parameters are passed to this function

def get_predictions(connection_params, model_id, start_time, end_time):
    """Connects to database and executes the SQL query using parameterized SQL"""
    try:
        conn = psycopg2.connect(**connection_params)
        cur = conn.cursor()
        query = "SELECT timestamp, actual, predicted FROM predictions WHERE model_id = %s AND timestamp BETWEEN %s AND %s"
        cur.execute(query, (model_id, start_time, end_time))
        results = cur.fetchall()
        cur.close()
        conn.close()
        return results
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error executing query: {e}")
        return []
#Example
# params = {"host": "localhost", "port":"5432", "user":"<dynamic_user>", "password":"<dynamic_password>", "database":"model_platform"}
# get_predictions(params, 1, "2024-01-27 12:00:00", "2024-01-27 13:00:00")

```
**Explanation:**

*   `%s` placeholders in the query, along with passing the parameters as a tuple to `cur.execute`, prevents any SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   Avoid using string interpolation to dynamically create queries. Always use placeholders.

**6. Detailed Model Deployment Workflow (Step-by-Step, Novice-Friendly)**

1.  **Directory Structure:**

    ```
    model_project/
    ├── model_code/
    │   ├── requirements.txt
    │   ├── model.py
    │   └── utils.py # Optional helper file
    └── Dockerfile
    ```
2.  **`requirements.txt` (Example):**

```
pmdarima==1.8.5
pandas==1.5.3
psycopg2==2.9.6
```

**Rationale:**
   *   Pin specific library versions to avoid conflicts and guarantee reproducibility. This also avoids security issues with libraries that may have known vulnerabilities in other versions. Always pin your library versions.
   *   `pmdarima==1.8.5`: The library used for creating ARIMA models.
   *   `pandas==1.5.3`:  Used for data manipulation if required. It is used in the example code for model execution.
   *   `psycopg2==2.9.6`: Used to access the database.

3. **`model.py` (Example with ARIMA):**

```python
import pandas as pd
import pmdarima as pm

        cur.execute(query, (model_id, now, predicted_value))
        conn.commit()
        cur.close()
        conn.close()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error saving prediction: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage: This would be called by the container with a crontab
    # and the appropriate variables
    # Read the connection string from environment variables
    connection_string = os.environ.get("DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING")
    model_id = os.environ.get("MODEL_ID")

    if not connection_string or not model_id:
        print("Missing connection parameters")
    # Parse connection parameters from the connection string

    parts = connection_string.split(" ")
    for part in parts:
      if "=" in part:
         key, value = part.split("=")
         params[key] = value

    #Get historical data
    data = get_historical_data(params, time_window_hours=24)
    if data is None:

    print(f"Prediction saved: {prediction} at {datetime.datetime.now()}")
```

**Explanation:**
*   **`TimeSeriesModel` (Abstract Base Class

Okay, let's continue with the detailed model deployment workflow, including the remaining components, explanations, and examples.

**Explanation (Continued):**

*   **`TimeSeriesModel` (Abstract Base Class):** This is the abstract base class that **all** time series models must inherit from. It ensures that all model classes implement the `fit()` and `predict()` methods. This enforced interface guarantees that the platform can invoke model code in a standard and predictable way. This greatly reduces the risk of unexpected errors or security breaches.
*   **`ARIMA_Model` (Concrete Class):** This is an example of a time series model that inherits from `TimeSeriesModel`, implementing the abstract methods and providing concrete implementation. This example shows how to create a concrete class that uses the `pmdarima` library to generate predictions based on the provided historical data.
*   **`get_historical_data` Function:** This function is responsible for connecting to the database and retrieving a maximum of 24 hours of historical time series data from the `predictions` table. The connection parameters are obtained from the environment variables (details below). The function returns `None` if no data is present.
*  **`save_prediction` Function:** This function connects to the database and saves the generated prediction to the `predictions` table. The function obtains its database connection parameters from the environment variables.
*   **`if __name__ == "__main__":` Block:** The main execution block reads the database connection string from the environment variables, and parses it. It reads the last 24 hours of data, trains the model, generates a single prediction, and saves that to the database.
*  **Error Handling:** Basic `try...except` blocks are used for error handling when accessing the database or when training the model.
*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   The database connection string is read from the environment variables. This avoids hardcoding credentials in the code.
    *   SQL parameters are used with `psycopg2` to avoid SQL injection.
    *   The code connects to the database using short-lived credentials (details below).

4.  **`utils.py` (Optional):** You can add any utility functions here. This file can be used to store any functions that are shared between models or classes. For example, specific data transformation logic could be placed here.

5.  **`Dockerfile` (Complete, Runnable Example with Security Explanations):**

```dockerfile
# Use a slim Python base image. This base image does NOT contain anything that we don't need
FROM python:3.11.6-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only the requirements file first. This ensures that requirements are only reinstalled when necessary and not on every build.
COPY model_code/requirements.txt .

# Install the required libraries. The '--no-cache-dir' directive avoids caching packages, to ensure a clean build.
# The '-U' directive updates the package installer, just in case
RUN pip install -U pip && pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the model code to the container
COPY model_code .

# Set the user to an unprivileged user instead of root. This reduces the attack surface.
# 1000 is just an example user id, use a specific user ID in your local system
# Create this user if not already present in your local system using `sudo useradd -u 1000 nonroot`
USER 1000

# Set the entrypoint: This is what will run when the container starts.
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "model.py"]
```

**Dockerfile Security Explanations:**

*   **`FROM python:3.11.6-slim`:** Uses the official Python slim image as the base. This minimizes the base image size, reducing the potential attack surface. The specific Python version is pinned (`3.11.6`) to avoid compatibility issues and vulnerabilities that may exist in other Python versions.
*   **`WORKDIR /app`:** Sets the working directory inside the container. This isolates the application within its own directory.
*   **`COPY model_code/requirements.txt .`:** Copies only the `requirements.txt` file first, before all the code. This leverages Docker's layer caching, ensuring that `pip install` only runs when the `requirements.txt` file changes, dramatically reducing build time.
*   **`RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`:** Installs dependencies using `pip`. The `--no-cache-dir` option prevents `pip` from caching downloaded packages, ensuring that each build is always clean and free of any old artifacts from previous builds. This is essential to maintain consistency and prevent security issues from corrupted cached packages.
*   **`COPY model_code .`:** Copies the rest of the model code into the `/app` directory.
*   **`USER 1000`:** Runs the container process with the user ID 1000. This prevents the container from running as `root` and reduces the impact if the container is compromised. This configuration ensures that if a user gains access to the container, their access is limited by the Linux user's privileges, and avoiding any kind of privilege escalation. The use of a non-root user is a critical security measure for containers.
*   **`ENTRYPOINT ["python", "model.py"]`:** Specifies that the Python interpreter is the entry point for the container, with `model.py` as the script that will be executed.

**Dockerfile Build Process (Example Commands):**

```bash
# Build the Docker image
# Build the image and explicitly avoid using any cached information
docker build --no-cache -t model-image .

# Verify that the image is present (optional)
docker images
```

**Running the container for debugging purposes outside of Kubernetes (Example Commands):**

```bash
docker run --rm -it -e DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING="host=localhost port=5432 user=model_user_1234 password=very_strong_password database=model_platform" -e MODEL_ID=1 model-image
```

*  This command runs the container in interactive mode, mapping the terminal and deleting the container once it is stopped.
*   The environment variables necessary to connect to the database and identify the model ID are passed.
*   This is very useful for debugging the container outside of Kubernetes.

**7. Frontend Recommendations (htmx/Jinja2 - Concrete Examples)**

**Rationale:**

*   **htmx:** This library allows you to create a dynamic website using simple HTML attributes, without writing JavaScript code. It's simple to learn and use.
*   **Jinja2:** This template engine renders HTML content server-side, also avoiding any kind of JavaScript complexity.
*   **Inline CSS:** Style is applied directly in the HTML using `style` attributes, avoiding CSS files and added complexity for this MVP.
*  **No JavaScript Charting Libraries:** The chart is generated in the server using the `chart.js` library, and the resulting HTML is embedded directly into the Jinja2 template.

**Explanation:**

*   **Token-based authentication**: The `auth` endpoint generates a token, and the `authenticate_user` method validates it. Each endpoint validates if the user is authorized before processing the request.
*   **Database Connection Management**: The `get_db_connection` function handles creating connections to the database using provided credentials.
*   **Subscription management (`/subscribe`, `/subscriptions`):** These endpoints implement the subscription logic, creating a user record and a token and storing them in the database, and returning the subscription information to the user.
*   **Model Deployment (`/models`)**: This method receives the model code (base64 encoded) and the model metadata from the user. It then proceeds to decode the code, save it to the database, and generate short-lived database credentials that are passed to a Kubernetes pod. The function then executes the Kubernetes command to deploy the model.
*   **Dynamic Database Credentials (`generate_database_credentials`):** This function generates unique database credentials, creates the database user with the minimum required privileges and returns the connection string that is passed to the pod as an environment variable.
*   **Prediction Retrieval (`/predictions`):**  The Flask application retrieves the predictions from the database. A maximum window of 24 hours is enforced.
*   **Index (`/`):** The root endpoint generates a very simple HTML page displaying the last 24 hours of predictions. The chart is generated entirely with the `chart.js` library server-side.
*   **Error Handling:** Specific error messages are generated for all API endpoints and returned using appropriate HTTP codes.
*   **Security:** The database connection credentials are passed as parameters to avoid any kind of hardcoding. The database query uses parameters to avoid SQL injection.  The model code is received and executed within a restricted container.

2.  **Jinja2 Template (Example `templates/index.html`):**

**Explanation:**

*   **Simple HTML Structure:** The template displays a basic HTML page with a title, a table to display prediction data, and a canvas element for a chart, all using inline CSS.
*   **Jinja2 Syntax:** The `{% for ... %}` loop iterates through the data passed from the Flask application.
*   **`{{ prediction.timestamp }}`:**  Jinja2 expressions are used to display the data from the predictions.
*   **Table Display:** Displays the predictions in a simple, clear, and easily readable table.
*  **Chart.js:** The `Chart.js` is used with minimal customization to generate the line chart directly in the browser. The chart is generated server-side, and there is no need for complex JavaScript code, making it easy to use even for a novice developer.
*   **Inline Style:** All styling is done using inline styles, which reduces the complexity of the solution, as you don't need to manage additional CSS files.

**8. Security Measures (Explicit, Practical, Step-by-Step)**

*   **Container Isolation (Docker & Kubernetes):**
    *   **Read-Only Filesystem (`securityContext`):**  The container's file system is set to read-only using the Kubernetes `PodSecurityContext`.
    *   **Minimal User Privileges (`USER` in Dockerfile, `securityContext`):** The container runs with a non-root user (user ID 1000) to prevent privilege escalation.
    *   **No Network Access (`NetworkPolicy`):** The Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` prevents any external network communication.

*   **Dynamic Database Credentials (Python):**
    *   The `generate_database_credentials` function generates short-lived database user credentials (username and password) for each model instance and returns a complete connection string for the pod.
    *  The model code uses this connection string to connect to the database with `psycopg2`.
    *  The model has **READ ONLY** access to the database. This ensures that even if the model is compromised, no data can be modified in the database, limiting potential damage.
*   **REST API Security:**
    *   Token-based authentication to secure all API endpoints.
    *   JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) would be a more robust solution, but this MVP is using a simplified token-based auth system.
    *   Parameterization in SQL queries to avoid SQL injection attacks.
    *   HTTP codes and response format follows strict API guidelines.
    *  Request payloads must strictly conform to JSON schema to avoid unexpected requests.
*   **Code Tampering Prevention:**
    *   Model code is executed within an immutable container.
    *  The `Dockerfile` ensures a completely clean build with the `--no-cache` flag.
    *   The model code is stored in the database and not modified directly, ensuring the integrity of the code.
*   **API Security:**
    *  Token-based authentication is implemented, where each token is unique per user and stored in the database, which requires a login to retrieve. Each API call must contain the authentication token in the headers.
*  **Deployment:**
    *   Model code is sent via secure POST requests. The model code is base64 encoded before sending it, preventing any characters that may conflict with the JSON parsing mechanisms.

**Complete, Detailed Security Checklist:**

1.  **Container Isolation:**
    *   ✅ Use a minimal base image for Docker (`python:3.11.6-slim`).
    *   ✅ Build the image with `--no-cache` to avoid caching data.
    *   ✅ Run the container with a non-root user (e.g., `USER 1000` in Dockerfile).
    *   ✅ Configure `securityContext` to enforce a read-only filesystem (`readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`) and disable privilege escalation (`allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`).
    *   ✅ Deploy the container in an isolated Kubernetes pod.
    *   ✅ Block all network traffic using `NetworkPolicy`.
    *   ✅ Ensure each model is deployed in a **NEW** container to ensure a clean environment every single time.
2.  **Database Access:**
    *   ✅ Use short-lived database credentials generated on demand for each model container.
    *   ✅ Grant models **ONLY READ ACCESS** to the database.
    *   ✅ Pass database credentials as environment variables, not hardcoded in model code.
    *   ✅ Use parameterized queries with `psycopg2` to prevent SQL injection.
    *  ✅ Sanitize database inputs and connection strings to avoid malicious characters.
3.  **API Security:**
    *   ✅ Implement token-based authentication for all API endpoints.
    *   ✅ Validate requests against predefined JSON schemas.
    *  ✅ Sanitize request and response data to prevent potential exploits.
4.  **Model Code Security:**
    *   ✅ Execute model code in a secure, isolated container environment.
    *   ✅ Store model code in the database and do not modify it.
    *   ✅ Ensure model code adheres to an abstract base class interface.
5.  **Deployment Security:**
    *   ✅ Store all secrets (tokens, connection strings) securely.
    *   ✅ Sanitize any data before sending it across the network.
    *  ✅ Ensure only HTTPS is used for all communication.
    * ✅  Avoid using shared or insecure environments.
