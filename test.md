I want to build a very scalable solution for machine learning and simulation. The idea is to use inifniband communication and have multiple server nodes with a disk image of our software. The user can easily remove and add nodes by just physically adding them through our server slot and our software will take care of automated load balancing and distributing the computation on all nodes based on their compute capability. The user will simply run a pytorch code with our software wrapper which will distribute the task automatically accross all available nodes. The idea is the end user would be able to add computing power by adding more nodes and also adding more powerful nodes (for example with more ram or cpu cores and etc). How should I go about doing this and in terms of hardware to build such a solution what are the most basic minimum requirements for testing and development?
