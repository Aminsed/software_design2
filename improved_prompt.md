I am building a platform for software developers, quants, and traders to host and monetize their Python-based code and models through subscriptions. Users will subscribe to hosted models and forecasting code, paying a monthly fee, with an optional trial period of up to one month. Once a model is deployed (serving predictions), it should be immutable, requiring a new version for any changes. This is crucial for preventing fraud. These models will operate in a sandboxed environment, with no internet access, and will only be able to query our database for technical data to generate forecasts.

I am a Machine Learning Engineer with experience in Flask, Docker, and Kubernetes, and I plan to host this platform on-premise. I have limited front-end experience but can use AI coding assistants for basic UI development. My goal is to create a practical and achievable platform that I can build myself, focusing on simplicity and ease of use for both developers publishing models and traders subscribing to them. The platform should be intuitive for Python developers to quickly publish their code and models, and the UI should provide clear performance metrics and prediction playback for subscribers, with a minimum prediction resolution of 1 hour.

I need a comprehensive, step-by-step plan for building this platform, with a strong emphasis on backend development and API design. The plan should be broken down into distinct, manageable phases, each with clear goals, deliverables, and estimated timelines. The API design and robust security are paramount.
