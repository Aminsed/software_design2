You are an expert software architect tasked with creating a highly detailed, phased, and immediately actionable development blueprint for a solo developer to build a platform for hosting and monetizing predictive models and trading algorithms. This platform will connect two distinct user groups: Signal Providers and Subscribers. The developer possesses experience in machine learning, Flask, Docker, FastAPI, and some Kubernetes, and will host the platform on-premise. Front-end development experience is limited, necessitating the strategic use of AI coding assistants. The platform must be designed for simplicity in development and maintenance, while also ensuring scalability and robustness. Your primary objective is to deliver a crystal-clear, step-by-step guide that the developer can immediately begin implementing. This guide should emphasize practical, hands-on instructions, complete with specific examples, code snippets, and configuration files. Assume the developer has a foundational understanding of the technologies mentioned but requires detailed guidance on their application to this specific project. Crucially, the response should be structured as a comprehensive, practical guide, not just a list of instructions.

Context & Constraints:

Developer: Solo developer proficient in machine learning, Flask, Docker, FastAPI, and with some Kubernetes knowledge. Limited front-end experience; must leverage AI coding assistants effectively.

Hosting: On-premise infrastructure.

Priorities: Simplicity, scalability, security, and immediate actionability.

Goal: A detailed, actionable plan that the developer can start implementing immediately, with clear steps, examples, and justifications. The plan should be so detailed that the developer can begin coding immediately after reviewing it.

User Groups:

Signal Providers: Software developers and quantitative analysts (quants) who will upload their Python-based forecasting models and code. They require an intuitive development kit for rapid deployment and management (publish, take offline, make public). Focus on a CLI-based approach for initial simplicity.

Subscribers: Traders and other users who will subscribe to these models for a recurring monthly fee, potentially after a trial period. They need a UI that clearly displays model performance, allows for playback of historical predictions, and is easy to navigate. Prioritize a simple, functional UI over a complex one.

Core Requirements:

Model Deployment & Security:

Immutability: Deployed models must be immutable. Updates require deploying a new version. Utilize Docker images with version tags. Provide a specific example of a Dockerfile and the exact commands to build and tag the image.

Sandboxing: Deployed models will have no internet access. They can only query the platform's internal database for technical data and generate forecasts. Implement network policies to enforce this. Provide specific examples of network policies (e.g., Kubernetes NetworkPolicy YAML).

Integrity: The platform must prevent fraud and ensure the integrity of the models and their predictions. Focus on input validation, secure API design, and data integrity checks. Provide specific examples of input validation (e.g., Pydantic model examples) and secure API design (e.g., JWT authentication implementation).

Development & Deployment:

Solo Developer: The developer is working alone.

On-Premise Hosting: The platform will be hosted on-premise.

Limited Front-End: The developer has limited front-end experience but must use AI coding assistants.

Simplicity & Scalability: The platform should be as simple as possible to develop and maintain, while being scalable and robust. Prioritize a microservices architecture from the outset.

User Experience:

Signal Providers: The development kit for publishing models should be intuitive for Python developers, allowing for quick deployment and management (publish, take offline, make public). Provide a CLI tool with clear commands and examples. Include example CLI commands and their expected behavior, including the exact output the user should see.

Subscribers: The UI must clearly display model performance, allow for playback of historical predictions, and be easy to navigate. Use React with Material UI, and leverage AI for initial code generation. Provide specific prompts to use with AI coding assistants (e.g., "Generate a React component using Material UI to display a table of model performance metrics").

Prediction Resolution: Predictions should be served at a minimum resolution of 1 hour.

Automation & Scalability:

Automated Workflow: The entire process of publishing, managing, and subscribing to models must be automated. Use a combination of API calls and background tasks.

Queuing System: A queuing system should manage model execution, optimizing resource usage (CPU/GPU). Use Celery with Redis as a broker. Explain why this choice is preferred over alternatives like RabbitMQ, with specific examples of their limitations in this context (e.g., "RabbitMQ's message acknowledgement model is less suitable for long-running tasks like model execution").

Scalable Architecture: The architecture must be highly scalable, allowing for easy addition of servers and storage to accommodate growth. Design for horizontal scaling from the beginning.

API Design:

API Focus: Prioritize the API design for both signal providers and subscribers. Use FastAPI for its ease of use and automatic documentation.

Signal Provider APIs: APIs to upload, manage (publish, take offline, make public), and monitor their models. Provide clear examples of API endpoints and request/response schemas in JSON format, including examples for all CRUD operations where applicable. Use OpenAPI/Swagger format for schemas.

Subscriber APIs: APIs to subscribe to models and retrieve predictions. Provide clear examples of API endpoints and request/response schemas in JSON format, including examples for all CRUD operations where applicable. Use OpenAPI/Swagger format for schemas.

Documentation: The API should be well-documented and easy to use. Use OpenAPI/Swagger for automatic API documentation. Provide example OpenAPI/Swagger schema definitions.

Deliverables:

Detailed Architecture Diagram and Component Explanation:

Generate a Mermaid syntax diagram illustrating the overall system architecture, including key microservices and their interactions.

For each component in the diagram, provide:

A clear explanation of its purpose within the system.

A specific technology recommendation (e.g., PostgreSQL for the database, Redis for the message queue, FastAPI for the API framework).

A detailed justification for choosing that specific technology, considering the solo developer's constraints and the platform's requirements. Explicitly state why other technologies were not chosen, with specific examples of alternatives and their drawbacks. Provide a comparative analysis table if possible.

A brief explanation of how the component will interact with other components. Include specific examples of data flow using JSON payloads.

Phased Development Plan with Actionable Steps:

Create a step-by-step development plan, broken down into logical phases. Prioritize API development in the initial phases, starting with core user authentication and model management.

Each phase must include:

A clear, measurable goal (e.g., "Implement user authentication API").

A list of specific, actionable tasks (e.g., "Create user model in database with fields: username, password_hash, email," "Implement JWT authentication middleware using FastAPI's security utilities," include specific code examples, including database schema definitions and API endpoint code).

An estimated time to complete (in days or weeks).

A clear definition of "done" (e.g., "All API endpoints for user authentication are implemented, tested with Pytest, and documented using OpenAPI/Swagger," include specific test cases with assertions and fixtures, and example OpenAPI schema definitions).

Identify dependencies between phases explicitly.

Present a Gantt chart or similar visualization if possible.

Desired Outcome:

A 100% practical, achievable, and detailed plan that the solo developer can follow to build this platform, starting with the core API design and progressing through all necessary phases. The plan should be clear, concise, and actionable, with a focus on simplicity, scalability, and security. The plan should provide specific examples, code snippets, and configurations for each step, rather than just high-level guidance. The plan should also include specific technology recommendations for each component of the platform, with detailed justifications for each choice, including why alternatives were not chosen, with specific examples. The plan should be broken down into phases with estimated time to complete each phase, and a clear definition of "done" for each phase. The plan should be detailed enough that the developer can begin implementation immediately after reviewing the plan. The plan should be structured to allow the developer to start coding immediately after reviewing the plan. The plan should be written in a way that is easy to understand and follow, even for a developer with limited experience in some areas. The plan should be written as if you are directly instructing the developer, providing clear, step-by-step instructions. Assume the developer has a basic understanding of the technologies mentioned but needs detailed guidance on how to apply them to this specific project, with specific code examples and configurations. The response should be formatted for easy readability, using clear headings, bullet points, code blocks, tables, and diagrams where appropriate. The response should be structured as a comprehensive guide, not just a list of instructions. The response should be formatted in markdown.
